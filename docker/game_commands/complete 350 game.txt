You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab
fallen from the ceiling (Slab Room).  There once were large passages
to the east and west, but they are now filled with boulders.  Low
small passages go north and south, and the south one quickly bends
east around the boulders.

of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is

overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
mist.  The only passage goes back toward the south.

above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
for the use of the dwarves, who as you know are extremely vain.)

The sepulchral voice intones, "The cave is now closed."  As the echoes
fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
smoke). . . .    Then your eyes refocus; you look around and find...

You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the
Giant Room.  It appears to be a repository for the "Adventure"
program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky
yellow light.  Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all
of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed
of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and
a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves
are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign nearby reads:  "DO
NOT DISTURB THE DWARVES!"  An immense mirror is hanging against one
wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other
sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.

You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one side is a pit
full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side is a row of small
wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird.  In one
corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends.
A large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.
A vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At your feet is a
large steel grate, next to which is a sign that reads, "TREASURE
VAULT.  KEYS IN MAIN OFFICE."
The grate is locked.

There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole
and find yourself in the main office, where a cheering band of
friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.
You scored 350 points out of a possible 350, using 353 turns.
All of Adventuredom gives tribute to you, Adventure Grandmaster!
To achieve the next higher rating would be a neat trick!
Congratulations!!
